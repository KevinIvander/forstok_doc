**B. Forstok Dashboard**

1.  **Pending Action**\
    ****Every new product imported from the marketplace to Forstok will notice as a Pending Action where it needs to be confirmed linking first. Because Forstok mapping uses sku code so Forstok will inform the seller which items have the same code or are still not neat. If the code is the same, then the item will stay in confirm linking and can be edited from Forstok. There are 4 categories of sku code that need to be considered:

    * SKU code is not matched: there can be 2 conditions.\
      1\. The item is a different sku code in each marketplace or sold in one marketplace \
      action: directly confirm\
      2\. The same item is sold in several marketplaces but the code is inputted incorrectly.\
      action: It needs to be fixed in the seller center marketplace.
    * SKU Code is matched: Is the SKU code already linking with other marketplaces or is same.\
      action: directly confirm
    * SKU code is empty: Is the SKU code is still empty or has not been filled in from the seller center.\
      action: My code is filled in from the marketplace.
    * SKU code is duplicate: Is duplicate or the same SKU code at the seller center.\
      action: It needs to be fixed in the seller center marketplace


2.  **Pending Orders**

    Items that have been imported or have entered Forstok will be in Pending Actions on the Forstok Dashboard. Later, we just need to confirm the item so that it can be edited from Forstok. There are several descriptions of the pending action:
