## How to Integrate JD.ID (Step-by-step)

Before integration into JD.ID, make sure your shop is a Qualified Seller. Because of JD.ID Open API is specifically for sellers who are already Qualified seller. If you are still a Basic Seller, please upgrade your store or register to become a Qualified Seller.

To register to become a Qualified Seller, please see the following link:

After your shop has been registered as a Qualified Seller, for this JD.ID you must first request an API Key directly from the web provided by the JD.ID team. The first steps to get the JD.ID API:

1. Log in to seller center JD.ID https://seller.jd.id. Then log in to your shop
