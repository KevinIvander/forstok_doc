If you want to listing to JD.ID and Woocommerce, you can not use by Forstok at the moment. Because there are some API limitations from marketplace that might do it directly from the seller center before you import to Forstok.

{% hint style="info" %}
* Before using a cross listing, make sure there is a master item first in the Forstok and **the Master Item data has been filled**.&#x20;
* For the **Zalora** Seller Center, it is recommended to use Add Single Item or edit items and then add Zalora channels, because if you use a cross listing, the uploaded image will follow the previous channel or the image in the master item and is likely to be rejected by Zalora.&#x20;
* **For cross listing by using POS (Point of Sales)** if the SKU is in the form of numbers as a whole, then there will be an additional @ in front of the SKU so that the SKU can be read by the system. For example SKU 11245476 on SKU Master and Code in the form of @11245476, the SKU should not be replaced before the SKU is uploaded.&#x20;
* **For filling the column must be in accordance with the format in the download template**, it should not change the conditions in the template, for example in the condition template is a list of dropdown then copy paste text to change the drop down list into an ordinary text.
* For **filling the brands column**, you can download the brand file after downloading the cross listing template then search for the name of the brand, copy the ID and the name of the brand then paste it in the brand column on the cross listing page.
