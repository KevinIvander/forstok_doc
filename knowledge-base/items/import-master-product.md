Forstok detects that the image has been successfully uploaded if we have made the sku code per image. Following are the steps and conditions for zip the image folder:

3\. The image is in accordance with the size set and has been sorted. From left to right or from the name of image 1 to so on, it means to be the main image. This means that the image will be the sequence of images that will be displayed in the marketplace.

4\. Merge the image into a folder that has been changed according to my code. For example, if you want to upload an image with 5 codes, it means that the folder must also be 5 folders.
