# Linking item/variants

Link to Another Variant aims to link those who have not grouped with other marketplaces or are wrongly linked. Can use this feature.

For example sku Tokopedia  FORS00000\
Want to be linked with Shopee and Blibli teams: WRL500

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (281).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png>)

&#x20;Here are the steps to link to another variant:\
1\. Search sku Tokopedia : FORS00000\
Then in the More option select Link to another variant

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (278).png>)

&#x20;2\. In the Link this variant dropdown, select Tokopedia

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (198).png>)

3\. In Choose a variant, enter the destination sku, namely Shopee and Blibli: WRL500, then click the link.

The item will be linked immediately. To check whether it is linked or not, search for one of the sku, if you have entered the grouping, it means that it is already linked.
