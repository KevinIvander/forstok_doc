# Step 1: SKU code matching

**What is SKU Code?**

SKU is a combination of letters or numbers that can be a unique code for identification for each product sold on the Marketplace. The SKU code must be unique and must be differentiated down to the variant level.

**Why is the SKU Code important?**

SKU codes are important and useful as a general reference for tracking inventory in every part of your business.

**Best Practices for SKU code:**

1. Make them unique - Create unique SKU codes for each inventory item you sell and never reuse SKU codes for items you no longer sell
2. Keep it short - the SKU code length should be no more than approx. 30 characters. Any longer than that and they become difficult to read and also may not work with some inventory management systems.
3. Never use spaces or special characters - Stick with simple characters that won't confuse people or the software system. Use only hyphens or periods as delimiters, and NEVER use spaces, slashes \(/ or \\), “&”, “%”, “?”
4. Don't just use product titles - Leave long descriptions for product titles, not SKU codes.
5. Never start your SKU code with zero - Unless you want to make your life miserable, don't start your SKU code with 0. Excel and other spreadsheet software will remove 0 and mess things up. Do not do it.
