# Step 3: Product Linking

After success integrates marketplace and product import. Then the imported products enter Pending Actions. Where it is necessary to confirm linking first. Because Forstok mapping uses SKU code so Forstok will inform the seller which items have the same code or are still not neat. If the code is the same, then the item will stay in confirm linking and can be edited from Forstok. There are 4 categories of SKU code that need to be considered:
